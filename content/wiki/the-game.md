Quests, roles, gems, levels, and achievements are all a part of what make Boot.dev courses unique. The goal of it all, is, of course, to make learning to code as fun as it can be. That said, we often get questions about how it all works, so this page is a living document that explains the mechanics of the Boot.dev game.

## Roles

Unlocking new roles is your primary objective in the game. You will start without a role, but upon reaching level `4`, you'll unlock your first role: "Apprentice".

Roles are unlocked by reaching certain levels. Your role is shown on your profile page, and it also gives you special perks and privileges in the [Discord community](https://boot.dev/community), where your role is shown next to your name.

* Apprentice: Level 4
* Pupil: Level 10
* Acolyte: Level 20
* Disciple: Level 30
* Scholar: Level 40
* Mage: Level 50
* Sage: Level 60

## Levels and XP

You can earn XP in a variety of ways, but the most common ways are by passing off assignments and earning achievements. Once you have enough XP, you will level up. Higher levels require more and more XP to unlock.

## Leaderboard

There are several sections on the [leaderboard](https://boot.dev/leaderboard), and each works a little differently. You'll gain a spot on the public leaderboard by being one of the top students in a given category for a specific timeframe.

For example, our daily leaderboard is very competitive: the students who have earned the most XP in the last 24 hours are shown at the top.

## Gems

You can earn gems in two different ways:

* Completing quests
* Unlocking new roles

Gems can be spent on two things:

* To recover your sharpshooter progress when you get an answer wrong
* To buy XP boosts

## XP Boosts

XP boosts are purchased with gems, and they give you a temporary multiplier for any XP that you earn. For example, you may get +25% XP for all assignments completed within the hour that a boost is active.

You can buy boosts by clicking on the gem icon in the sidebar, as long as you have enough gems (10).

## Quests

Completing quests will award you with gems. You complete quests by earning a certain amount of XP within a week. The harder the quest, the more XP you'll need to earn, and the more gems you'll gain as a reward.

You may only have a single quest active at any given time. You can select a quest if you don't have one yet from the [questboard](https://boot.dev/questboard).

## Achievements

The primary purpose of achievements is to award you with bonus XP, but when you earn achievements you'll also unlock the associated badge on your portfolio page. There are many different ways in which achievements can be earned, each achievement is different. You can read about the available achievements on the [achievements page](https://boot.dev/achievements).

## Karma

Karma is a measure of how helpful you are to others in the [Discord community](https://boot.dev/community). Karma is shown on your profile and the members with the highest karma earn a spot on the [leaderboard](https://boot.dev/leaderboard).

* Sending messages in the Discord server
* Receiving emojis from other users on your messages in the Discord server
* Receiving "thanks" from other users in the Discord server
