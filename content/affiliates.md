If you’re interested in promoting computer science education and don’t mind making some money as well then become a [Boot.dev affiliate partner by creating an account on Rewardful](https://bootdev.getrewardful.com/signup).

## Promote content you know your audience will love.

We wouldn’t want anyone to promote Boot.dev if they don’t absolutely love what we’re building. If you have a dev blog, tweet about tech stuff, or just have an online following you’re looking to monetize then we’d love to have you as a partner.

If you have any feedback for us on how we can improve the content or student experience we want to know! Check out our contact page for more details.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What does Boot.dev sell?

We sell patron features. A [patron account](https://boot.dev/pricing) allows students to get instant feedback on their coding assignments, unlock certifications, and earn achievements. If you aren’t familiar with the product, please create an account and learn about it before promoting it. It doesn’t make sense to promote a product you don’t love.

### How often am I paid?

Payouts are made during the first week of each month. At that time we pay all commissions that were earned at least 30 days prior, and we do this simply to avoid issues with refunds.

### Are taxes withheld?

No, you’re going to need to report your own earnings to whatever tax authority you are beholden to. If you make more than $600 in a calendar year we will reach out and require that you fill out a [1099-MISC](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1099msc.pdf) form, or if you are outside the US we’ll need a [W-8BEN](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8ben.pdf) signed.

## Rules

We hold our affiliates to a high standard. We reserve the right to ban you from the affiliate program if we determine you’re using any practices that don’t uphold our values.

### Don’t spam

Don’t post in online communities that aren’t yours. If we find you making low-effort spam posts you’ll be removed from the program.

### Don’t pretend to work for Boot.dev

Feel free to recommend Boot.dev to your fans, community or audience, but do not mislead them by claiming or implying you work for Boot.dev.

### Stay on brand

At Boot.dev we believe in quality first for all our products and messaging. Don’t post anything low-effort.

## Recommendations

###  Create content that potential users of Boot.dev want to read.

For example, you could write blog posts that relate directly to what Boot.dev offers. "9 Ways to Teach Yourself to Code" would be a great article to write, and you could include a link to Boot.dev within one of the sections.

### Use relevant content you’ve created in the past.

If you already have blog posts or videos that get organic traffic, consider adding a section that talks about Boot.dev. If you already have great content you should think about how you can use it.

### Avoid low-effort posts

Don’t just tweet your affiliate link with no context, provide value to your audience every time you create content. Low-effort posts won’t result in sales for you or us, and they just ruin your personal brand.
