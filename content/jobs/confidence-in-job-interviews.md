When talking about programming interviews, I think we often do a great job of flogging the dead horse that is whiteboarding problems. While the *hard* skills you'll need to be able to solve techincal interview problemms are necessary, it's also critically important to work on your *soft* skills.

From a high-level, there are two qualities you *really* want to exhibit in a coding interview:

* Confidence
* Humility

Let's talk about why these two qualities are so important.

## At the end of the day, companies don't hire people. People hire people

When you walk (or sign in)

## People hire people who will make their job easier

## People hire people who will learn and adapt quickly

## People hire people who are enjoyable to work with

## People do not hire people out of pity

## Don't trash talk past employers and coworkers

## Be upbeat and positive

## Make problems a team effort

## Know-it-alls are not enjoyable to work with
